Question 1
  What is the time, space complexity of following code:
  int a = 0, b = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  a = a + 1;
  }
  for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
  b = b + j;
  }
Ans. Time complexity is O(N+M).  Space complexity is O(1).


Question 2
  What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
  a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
  b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
  c)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly large inputs
  d)Y will be a better choice for small inputs
Ans. a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
